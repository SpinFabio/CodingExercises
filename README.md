#Collection of Programming Exercises
This repository contains my collection of exercises aimed at improving my skills as a programmer and problem solver. I plan to archive all standalone exercises that are too small to warrant their own project.

Where possible, I will include the exercise text or provide a link to the original source.

The exercises are categorized into three broad categories:

* Basic: Exercises focused on foundational concepts or learning a new programming language.
*  Intermediate: Exercises that require a deeper understanding of algorithms and problem-solving techniques.
*  Advanced: Challenging exercises, including classic problems like creating a text editor or developing a graphics renderer from scratch.
